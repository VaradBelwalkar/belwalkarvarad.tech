## About

I love to write blogs as my hobby and share my learnings and insights into complex topics 🙌 

I write about a [wide range of topics](/categories/), from in-depth [tutorials for projects](/tags/apache-apisix/) that keep me up at night to the [goals in life](/tags/life/) that keep me inspired.

I enjoy travelling, exploring new places and having fun there 😃
I enjoy goinn on mountains, nature 🌴 🌲
