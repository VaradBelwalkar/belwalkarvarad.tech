When working with Azure, first thing you will notice that it is not that much UI/UX friendly compared to AWS.

AWS has done much better in terms of User Experience.

You can even self-learn the AWS just from the UI.

But with Azure, things go pretty confusing at first, as working with Azure is better when your workload is mostly script driven.

### Resource Groups

By the way, when working with Azure, the first thing you will notice is its **Resource Groups**.

Azure manages resources based on Resource groups.

So when you sign-in into the Console, the first thing you will notic is the 




aws workflow is straight forward, when you want to use ec2 under free tier, you are given instance hours.

when working with s3 bucket, you are limited to api calls you make to avail free tier.

When using route53, you don't get any.

AWS has straightforward workflow, so you don't get to know when you are benifiting from free tier, and when not, it is crystal clear, and i like that.


But working with Azure is much more trickier.

Because here you are getting credits to work with.

and the resources are associated with subscription. the most confusing part!
