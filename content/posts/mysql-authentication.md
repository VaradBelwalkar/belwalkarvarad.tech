## Understanding MySQL Authentication 🛡️
MySQL authentication can be intricate, especially when running scripts or programmatically connecting to the MySQL instance. The complexity arises from MySQL's use of authentication plugins to verify the user interacting with the MySQL daemon.

### Authentication Plugin Challenges 🤔

When using MySQL with `sudo` privileges:

```shell
sudo mysql
```

Being a superuser grants direct access to the `root` account without requesting a password. However, attempting to log in manually without `sudo`:

```shell
mysql
```

Results in a permission denied error. Even providing the correct password for the `root` account:

```shell
mysql -u root -p
```

Leads to permission denied issues. This is because the default authentication mechanism for the root account is set to auth_socket (Unix socket). Consequently, accessing `/var/run/mysql.sock` is necessary for authentication, which normal user can't.

### Authentication Plugin Switch 🔄
To resolve this challenge, change the authentication plugin to `mysql_native_password`. This plugin authenticates based on the password, independent of machine privileges or local/remote execution.

Now, you can successfully execute:

```shell
mysql -u root -p
```
Simply provide the password, and access is granted. This solution also ensures remote or programmatic interactions work seamlessly.

### Checking and Updating Authentication Plugin

To check the current authentication plugin:

```sql
SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'root';
```

If the plugin is set to `auth_socket` or `unix_socket`, it implies root user authentication relies on system credentials. To enable password-based authentication, update the plugin:

```sql

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'new_password';
```

After updating the authentication plugin, reload the grant tables and apply the changes:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
This approach ensures a smooth MySQL authentication experience, making it accessible via various methods while maintaining security measures. 🚀
